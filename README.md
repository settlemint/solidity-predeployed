## Get started

Launch this smart contract set in SettleMint under the `Smart Contract Sets` section. This will automatically link it to your own blockchain node and make use of the private keys living in the platform.

If you want to use it separately, bootstrap a new project using

```shell
forge init my-project --template settlemint/solidity-predeployed
```

Or if you want to use this set as a dependency of your own,

```shell
npm install @settlemint/solidity-predeployed
```

## Alloc Array
```json
{}
```
